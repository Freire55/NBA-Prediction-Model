Predicting professional basketball games is a challenging machine learning problem due to changing team strength, roster availability, schedule effects, and the inherently stochastic nature of sports.

This project implements a fully chronological end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts NBA game outcomes using only information available **before tip-off**. The pipeline combines leak-free feature engineering, time-aware model selection, probability calibration, ensemble learning, and explainability techniques to produce realistic predictions on unseen NBA seasons.

Rather than maximizing raw accuracy alone, the project emphasizes **sound machine learning engineering practices**, including chronological validation, reproducibility, calibrated probability estimation, and model interpretability.

# 🚀 Motivation

Sports prediction is one of the most difficult supervised learning problems because outcomes depend on numerous dynamic factors that evolve throughout a season.

Many public NBA prediction projects unintentionally introduce target leakage by allowing future information into training features or evaluation.

This project was built around one guiding principle:

> **Every prediction must be generated using only information that would have been available before the game began.**

The objective is to demonstrate robust machine learning engineering practices rather than simply maximizing predictive accuracy.

# 📊 Dataset

Historical data is collected directly from the official **NBA Stats API (`nba_api`)**.

The dataset contains every NBA regular-season game from **2000 onward**, including:

- Team box scores
- Player box scores
- Matchups
- Game dates
- Team statistics

No betting odds, proprietary datasets, or manually curated information are used.

---

# 🧠 Feature Engineering

Every feature is computed exclusively from information available before each game.

The feature set includes:

- Continuous Elo ratings
- Rolling team statistics
- Rolling offensive and defensive ratings
- Era-normalized (Z-score) statistics
- Rest advantage
- Back-to-back indicators
- Road trip length
- Player Game Score
- Active roster strength
- Expected player impact

All rolling statistics are shifted so the current game is never included, eliminating target leakage.

---

# 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Three independent classifiers are trained:

- Logistic Regression
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- XGBoost

Hyperparameters are optimized using **RandomizedSearchCV** with **TimeSeriesSplit**, ensuring every validation fold occurs strictly after its corresponding training data.

All models are probability-calibrated before ensemble optimization.

---

# ⚖️ Ensemble Learning

Instead of averaging model predictions equally, validation-set probabilities are combined using a constrained optimization procedure that directly minimizes **Log Loss** while enforcing non-negative weights that sum to one.

For the final model, the learned ensemble assigned approximately:

| Model | Weight |
|--------|-------:|
| Logistic Regression | **67%** |
| MLP | 29% |
| XGBoost | 4% |

---

# 📈 Model Comparison

Although Neural Networks and Gradient Boosted Trees are often expected to outperform linear models, the opposite occurred in this project.

After hyperparameter optimization, probability calibration, and ensemble learning, **Logistic Regression consistently achieved the strongest overall performance**.

This suggests that the engineered features capture most of the predictive signal in a largely linear manner, while more flexible models primarily learn additional noise.

An important takeaway from this project is:

> **Strong feature engineering can be more valuable than increasing model complexity.**

---

# 🔍 Explainability

The pipeline automatically generates multiple explainability reports:

- SHAP summary plots (XGBoost)
- Permutation importance (MLP)
- Logistic Regression coefficients
- ROC curve
- Calibration curve
- Confusion matrix
- Combined feature rankings

These reports help explain both global feature importance and individual model behaviour.

---

# 📈 Evaluation Strategy

The dataset is split chronologically.

| Dataset | Seasons |
|----------|----------|
| Training | 2000–2018 |
| Validation | 2019–2020 |
| Testing | 2021–Present |

The test set is never used during feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble optimization, or model calibration.

This evaluation protocol closely mirrors how the model would perform in a real deployment.

---

# 🔒 Preventing Target Leakage

Every stage of the pipeline was explicitly designed to avoid future information leaking into model training.

Examples include:

- Shifted rolling windows
- Pre-game Elo ratings
- Rolling player statistics
- Chronological train/validation/test split
- TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation

As a result, every prediction reflects only information that would have been available before tip-off.

---

# 📦 Generated Artifacts

Each training run automatically produces a timestamped experiment folder containing:

- Trained models
- Feature scaler
- Learned ensemble weights
- Hyperparameter search results
- Evaluation metrics
- Feature importance rankings
- SHAP visualizations
- Calibration curve
- ROC curve
- Confusion matrix
- Training logs

Every experiment is fully reproducible.
